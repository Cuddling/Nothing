# Nothing
**Nothing** is a lightweight Shopify checkout automation tool written in Go. 

## General

This tool was developed and used throughout 2022 to automatically secure hyped and limited products on various Shopify sites that did not utilize bot protection.

Nothing has the ability to connect directly to Zephyr monitors for its blazing fast product feed and **requires a valid Zephyr AIO license key.** 

It's worth noting that you can only have one connection to Zephyr's monitor websocket server at a time per license key â€” meaning you **cannot reuse the same license key** to create multiple Nothing instances.

## Support & Documentation
